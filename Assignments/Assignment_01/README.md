# Assignment 1 - Database Migrations with Postgres SQL and AI-Assistance

## Description

This project involves setting up a database using PostgreSQL and managing database migrations with Goose in a Go environment. The goal is to create and migrate three tables while documenting the process through an AI-assisted research conversation.

## Steps to Complete the Project

Step 1: Install `Go` in your local
Step 2: Install `Goose`
Step 3: Install `Postgres`
Step 4: Research together with any AI Tool that can share link for the conversations. Either `Chatgpt` or `Gemini`.
Step 5: Work with it to formulate 3 tables
Step 6: Once you have settled on the design for the tables, use Goose to create migrations files for each of these tables
Step 7: Put the link of your conversation with Chatgpt or Gemini in a txt file
Step 8: Together with the txt file, and the migration files, create a zip file and submit it here before midnight tonight.

### Submission

Create a zip file containing:

- `migrations/` (directory with migration files)
- `ai_research.txt` (link to AI conversation)
- `screenshots` (to verify successful migration)
